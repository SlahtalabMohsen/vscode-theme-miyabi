# Miyabi Theme for Visual Studio Code

A refined and elegant theme for Visual Studio Code, inspired by the Japanese concept of "Miyabi" — a timeless aesthetic of grace and sophistication. This dark theme features a striking purple palette as its key color, blended with oceanic blue tones, creating a cyberpunk-inspired yet serene coding environment. Perfect for developers seeking both style and comfort during long coding sessions.

## 🎨 Features

- **Elegant Purple Palette**: Highlights are dominated by rich purples (`#1A004D`, `#BB86FC`) complemented by cyan accents (`#00E5FF`).
- **Comfortable Contrast**: Designed for all-day use with a dark base (`#0A0E1A`) and soft foregrounds (`#E0F2FF`).
- **Customizable UI**: Seamlessly integrates with VS Code's UI, including title bars, tabs, and sidebars, all tailored to the Miyabi aesthetic.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Enhanced token colors for readability across languages like JavaScript, Python, Markdown, and more.
